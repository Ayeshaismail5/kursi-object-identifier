# kursi-object-identifier
A web-based rule-based system for classifying plastic objects (black, transparent, colorful) and assigning them to the correct conveyor belt â€” built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
# Kursi Object Identifier

This is a web-based image classification tool designed for Kursi, a leading plastic recycling company. The system detects whether a plastic object is **black**, **transparent**, or **colorful**, and automatically assigns it to the appropriate conveyor belt (A, B, or C).

Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project simulates an intelligent sorting mechanism using rule-based image analysis. It works entirely in the browser and requires no backend or installation.

## Conveyor Belt Rules:
- ðŸ–¤ Black Object â†’ Belt A
- ðŸ§¼ Transparent Object â†’ Belt B
- ðŸŽ¨ Colorful Object â†’ Belt C

Perfect for demonstrating critical thinking, problem-solving, and real-world application of front-end technologies.
